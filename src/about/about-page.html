<h1>About</h1>
<p>This repo is simply an example for some angular testing. A couple of goals of mine were:
    <ul>
        <li>Angular ES6</li>
        <li>UI Router</li>
        <li>ArcGIS Implementation</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In addition, gulp and build tasks were implemented to make life easier :)
    <ul>
        <li>Browser sync on edits</li>
        <li>Webpack, dawg</li>
    </ul>
